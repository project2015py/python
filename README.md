# python
The projects involves computing packages like numpy and scipy.
Isolated fragments of the reconstruction software that are candidates for distributed -memory parallel implementation via MPI
Implemented and unit- tested python code with PyUnit for heterogeneous objects in images
Optimized performance by parallel computing through multi-thread and defining the field of fft and implementing hetero switch generator and instruction files
